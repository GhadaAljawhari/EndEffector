Arduino Arm End Effector_Smart Methods summer training

*Note: The dimensions of the arm are only approximations, they must be modified according to user's needs. 

The following line describes the principal of the designed end effector, which is part 
of the Smart Methods summer training.
As an end effector, this hollow ball is designed to be light and easy to control. It is covered with sharp, small terminals that can serve as weapons during robot battles. The joint connecting the ball to the arm is rotatable so it can be easily controlled by the user.
